# BMI CAlCULATOR

## HOW IT Works?

- 2 ways:
    -Standard way
    -Metric way

### Standard
    Pounds and inches	
    - Formula: weight (lb) / [height (in)]2 x 703 -

    Calculate BMI by dividing weight in pounds (lbs) by height in inches (in) squared and multiplying by a conversion factor of 703.

    Example: 
        Weight = 150 lbs
        Height = 5’5″ (65″)
        Calculation: [150 ÷ (65)2] x 703 = 24.96

### Metic Way
    Kilograms and meters (or centimeters)
    - Formula: weight (kg) / [height (m)]2 -

    With the metric system, the formula for BMI is weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared.

    Example:
        Weight = 68 kg
        Height = 165 cm (1.65 m)
        Calculation: 68 ÷ (1.65)2 = 24.98
